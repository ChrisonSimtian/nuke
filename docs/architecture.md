# Architecture

Canonical reference for how the Fallout repo is laid out and how the pieces fit together.

## Top-level layout

```

```

## Why the layout looks like this

### `src/` vs `tests/` split

Production code and tests live in separate top-level directories so:

- Project filters in IDEs map cleanly to "what ships" vs "what verifies."
- CI can target `tests/**` patterns without writing per-project exclusions.
- `IsPackable` is name-based (`MSBuildProjectName.EndsWith('Tests')` → false) — no manual opt-out per project.

The previous monorepo style under `source/` mixed both, and `source/Directory.Build.props` had to special-case the `*.Tests` projects. After the split, the split is structural.

### `.assets/` for binary content

Images, icons, logos, and other non-code binary content live under `.assets/`. The leading dot keeps it out of most CI path filters and signals "not source." The package icon (`.assets/icon.png`) is referenced via `$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory).assets\icon.png` in `Directory.Build.props` — independent of project depth.

### `build/` consumes the rest of the repo (dogfooding)

`build/_build.csproj` `ProjectReference`s `src/Nuke.Components`, `src/Nuke.Tooling.Generator`, and `src/Nuke.SourceGenerators`. Any change to the framework can be exercised by running `./build.ps1` — if the build itself breaks, you'd notice immediately.

### Shared build files hoisted to root

`Directory.Build.props` and `AssemblyInfo.cs` live at the repo root rather than under `src/` or `tests/`. Reason: both `src/<Project>/` and `tests/<Project>/` projects need to inherit them, and hoisting to root means MSBuild's directory walk finds them once without per-tree duplication.

## Project groupings under `src/`

| Area | Projects | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Core framework | `Fallout.Common`, `Fallout.Build`, `Fallout.Build.Shared`, `Fallout.Components`, `Fallout.Tooling` | The API consumers reference and the host runtime that executes targets. |
| Code generation | `Fallout.SourceGenerators`, `Fallout.Tooling.Generator` | Roslyn source generators that produce per-target code at compile time, plus the `.cs`-from-`.json` tool-wrapper generator. |
| Models | `Fallout.ProjectModel`, `Fallout.SolutionModel` | Strongly-typed wrappers over `.csproj` / `.sln` / `.slnx`. |
| Tooling | `Fallout.Cli`, `Fallout.MSBuildTasks` | The `dotnet fallout` global tool and the MSBuild tasks layer it builds on. |
| Utilities | `Fallout.Utilities` + sub-packages (`IO.Compression`, `IO.Globbing`, `Net`, `Text.Json`, `Text.Yaml`) | Standalone helpers reusable outside the build context. |

Every project under `src/` has a sibling under `tests/` (e.g. `src/Fallout.Common/` → `tests/Fallout.Common.Tests/`).

## Engine internals

This file covers *layout*. For how the build orchestrator works inside — the static-state model, the god class, and the `[Foundation]` de-statification epic that reshapes it (with as-is / to-be diagrams) — see [engine-de-statification.md](engine-de-statification.md).

## Build conventions

- **Central package versions.** All `PackageReference` versions live in `Directory.Packages.props`. Never inline `Version=` on a `PackageReference` — the build will error. Don't bypass this or `Directory.Build.targets` with project-local overrides.
- **Smart `PackageReference`.** `Directory.Build.targets` rewrites `PackageReference`s that match a project in the current solution into `ProjectReference`s. Lets us reference our own packages by ID across the dev/release boundary.
- **`AssemblyInfo.cs` at root.** Shared `InternalsVisibleTo` declarations. Included automatically via `Directory.Build.props`.
- **No per-file license headers.** The MIT notice lives in [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/Fallout-build/Fallout/blob/main/LICENSE) at the repo root. NuGet packages declare MIT via `PackageLicenseExpression` in `Directory.Build.props`. Vendored Microsoft code under `src/Persistence/Fallout.Persistence.Solution/` keeps its own headers — leave those alone.
- **Don't reintroduce `source/` or `images/`.** Production code lives under `src/`, tests under `tests/` (see the split rationale above); binary assets live under `.assets/`.
- **Don't commit build output.** No `output/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, or the generated `fallout-global.sln`/`fallout-global.*` files (produced by `GenerateGlobalSolution`).

## CI layout

| Workflow | When it runs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `build.yml` (generated) | Every PR targeting `main`, `release/*`, or `support/*` (with `paths-ignore` for docs/.assets/markdown) | Test + Pack on Linux. Fast feedback loop; the job `ubuntu-latest` is the only required status check. |
| `build-skip.yml` | Docs-only PRs to the same branches | No-op that reports the `ubuntu-latest` check so docs-only PRs aren't blocked. |
| `build-cross-platform.yml` (generated) | PRs targeting `release/*` / `support/*`, and `v*` tag pushes | Test + Pack on macOS **and** Windows (one job each). Gated to release intent. |
| `publish-packages-preview.yml` | Push to `main` | Test + Pack + publish `-preview` to GitHub Packages only. |
| `publish-packages-release.yml` | `v*` tag push on a production branch (or `workflow_dispatch`) | Test + Pack + publish to GitHub Packages + GitHub Releases (nuget.org opt-in). |

Linux runs on every PR because it's cheap and fast; macOS and Windows are gated to release intent (release/support PRs and release tags) to save CI minutes. On `main` the Linux gate plus the preview pipeline are the edge; if cross-platform breaks it surfaces on a release PR or tag and we fix before shipping.

## What this doc deliberately does NOT cover

- API design decisions inside individual projects — read the project's tests for those.
- Rebrand status and migration strategy — see `AGENTS.md` and the [Fallout rebrand milestone](https://github.com/Fallout-build/Fallout/milestone/1).
- Contribution workflow — see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

When in doubt, the structure is whatever this file says it is. If you change the layout, update this file in the same PR.
